# Aurelia App
This is an example of a single page app built using Aurelia framework. I have built it following a Pluralsight tutorial [Aurelia Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aurelia-fundamentals/table-of-contents).

I have added a number of my own views to this SPA.


### Server

This application runs using node server. To get started run following commands:

`npm install`

`jspm install`

`chmod +x server.sh`

`./server.sh`

Application can be viewed on `localhost:1812/index.html`.

Note 1812 because of FarScape [farscape.wikia.com](http://farscape.wikia.com/wiki/DRD_%221812%22)

### Running the application

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:1812/index.html/` to see the app running in your browser.
